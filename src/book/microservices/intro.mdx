title: Introduction to Microservices
---

Have you heard of the new buzz-word floating around knows as microservices.
So what exactly are microservices?

Microservice architecture is a way to structure your app in which many the functionality is split up into smaller services
known as microservices.
These microservices can communicate with each other using techniques like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls),
or by using a messaging queue like rabbitmq.

## Benefits

- Your application is more maintainable, thanks to smaller chunks of code to work at once
- Easier collaboration, like each team can work on one microservice
- In production, you can update a service without affecting other parts of your application, resulting in lower error probabilities

In this section, we will learn to create microservices, and how to communicate between them using JSON-RPC.
Why not gRPC? Well deno doesn't (yet) have a well documented gRPC library.
