title: Integration with HTTP
---

In the [previous section](/microservices/hello), we made a math server, and a consumer
to consume them and print out the result to the console. In this section,
we will integrate it with `oak` as an API gateway.

We will be continuing the code from the previous section.
First step is to delete the `consumer.ts` file,
and add `oak` as a dependency to the `deps.ts` file.

```ts title=deps.ts
export { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new folder named `gateway`, and create `index.ts` and `consumer.ts` files in it.
In the `gateway` folder, we will add another folder named `routes`, and create `index.ts` and `math.ts` files in it.

Final directory structure should look like:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── README.md
├── deps.ts
├── gateway
│   ├── consumer.ts
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── routes
│       ├── index.ts
│       └── math.ts
└── services
    └── math
        ├── add.ts
        ├── index.ts
        └── subtract.ts

4 directories, 9 files
```

Now, in the `gateway/consumer.ts` file, we will first import the `createRemote` module from `deps.ts`.
We will also create a RPC remote to `localhost:9876` as our math service is listening on port `9876`.

```ts title=gateway/consumer.ts
import { createRemote } from "../deps.ts";

export const remote = createRemote("http://localhost:9876");
```

Notice here we export the `remote`, as we will use it later.

Now, in the `gateway/routes/math.ts` file, we will start by importing the `Router` module of oak from `deps.ts`.
We will also import the `remote` we exported in the `gateway/consumer.ts` file.

```ts title=gateway/routes/math.ts
import { Router } from "../../deps.ts";
import { remote } from "../consumer.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new `Router` instance with the prefix of `/math`, as we will expose the endpoints on `/math/add` and `/math/subtract`.

```ts title=gateway/routes/math.ts
const router = new Router({
  prefix: "/math",
});
```

Now, we will create the routes themselves.
We will make use of route parameters, which were explained in the [Deep Dive into Routing](/http/routing-advanced) section.

```ts title=gateway/routes/math.ts
router.get("/add/:a/:b", async (ctx) => {
  const result = await remote.add(Number(ctx.params.a), Number(ctx.params.b));

  ctx.response.body = result;
});

router.get("/subtract/:a/:b", async (ctx) => {
  const result = await remote.subtract(
    Number(ctx.params.a),
    Number(ctx.params.b)
  );

  ctx.response.body = result;
});
```

Here, we accept `a` and `b` as the route parameters, and then typecast it to `number` and subsequently call the method using RPC, and then return the result.

Finally, we need to export the router to allow our oak server to use it as a middleware.

```ts file=gateway/routes/math.ts
export default router;
```

Setting up our `gateway/routes/index.ts` file, we need to first import, and then export the `mathRouter` from `gateway/routes/math.ts` file.

```ts title=gateway/routes/index.ts
import mathRouter from "./math.ts";

export { mathRouter };
```

Coming to the oak server, the `gateway/index.ts` will server as the entrypoint for our API gateway.

First, we will import the `Application` module from `deps.ts`
and the `mathRouter` from the `gateway/routes/index.ts` file.

```ts title=gateway/index.ts
import { Application } from "../deps.ts";
import { mathRouter } from "./routes/index.ts";
```

Now, we will make a new instance of the application class,
as well as consume the middleware provided by `mathRouter.routes()`.

```ts title=gateway/index.ts
const app = new Application();

app.use(mathRouter.routes());
```

Finally, let's start the application using the `listen` function.

```ts title=gateway/index.ts
console.log("Listening on :3000");
await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

Summing up the `gateway/index.ts` file,

```ts title=gateway/index.ts
import { Application } from "../deps.ts";
import { mathRouter } from "./routes/index.ts";

const app = new Application();

app.use(mathRouter.routes());

console.log("Listening on :3000");
await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

Now, let's start the service and the gateway.

Opening `localhost:3000/math/add/1/2` should result in 3 as the result.
We did it, we exposed the service as an API.

## TL;DR

In this section, we integrated our service with HTTP and oak.
The code for this section is available [here](https://github.com/gargakshit/deno-book-code/tree/microservices-2).
