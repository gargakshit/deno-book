title: Hello Microservices
---

In this section, we will create a basic (like really basic) microservice for basic arithmetic operations like add and subtract.
We will use JSON-RPC to communicate between services.

So, let's begin by starting with a fresh project.

First, we need to export our dependencies using the `deps.ts` file.

```ts title=deps.ts
export { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.62.0/http/server.ts";
export { respondRpc } from "https://deno.land/x/gentleRpc/rpcServer.ts";
export { createRemote } from "https://deno.land/x/gentleRpc/rpcClient.ts";
```

Here, we use the standard `server` module, and `respondRpc` and `createRemote` from the `gentleRpc` library.
But why aren't the imports for gentleRpc versioned? Isn't it a good practice.
Well at the time or writing, the latest published version of the library had an issue,
but the `master` branch seems to be fine.

So first, we will create the math service.

## Creating the service

Create a new folder `services` and then a folder `math` in it.

Now, we need a couple of files in the `services/math` folder, namely
`add.ts`, `subtract.ts` and `index.ts`.

We will also create a `consumer.ts` file in the project root, which will later help us consume the service.

The final directory structure should look like:

```bash
$ tree
.
â”œâ”€â”€ consumer.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ deps.ts
â””â”€â”€ services
    â””â”€â”€ math
        â”œâ”€â”€ add.ts
        â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
        â””â”€â”€ subtract.ts

2 directories, 5 files
```

Now, we will start by adding the logic in the `add.ts` and `subtract.ts` files respectively.

```ts file=services/math/add.ts
export const add = (x: number, y: number): number => x + y;
```

```ts file=services/math/subtract.ts
export const subtract = (x: number, y: number): number => x - y;
```

Well its just the basic logic for add and subtract ðŸ˜….

Coming to the `services/math/index.ts` file, we will start by importing
`serve` and `respondRpc` modules from the `deps.ts` file.

```ts file=services/math/index.ts
import { serve, respondRpc } from "../../deps.ts";
```

We will also import the `add.ts` and `subtract.ts` files now.

```ts file=services/math/index.ts
import { add } from "./add.ts";
import { subtract } from "./subtract.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new instance of the `serve` module,
and subsequently creating a `service`.

```ts file=services/math/index.ts
const server = serve({ port: 9876 });

const mathService = {
  add,
  subtract,
};
```

Here, we use the port `9876` as our JSON-RPC port.

As we learnt in the [simple web server section](/hello-world/web-server),
`serve` creates an async iterable. We can iterate over it, and respond to the RPC requests.

```ts file=services/math/index.ts
for await (const req of server) {
  await respondRpc(req, service);
}
```

Here, we respond to the RPC request using the `respondRpc` module of the `gentleRpc` library.

To sum up the code,

```ts file=services/math/index.ts
import { serve, respondRpc } from "../../deps.ts";
import { add } from "./add.ts";
import { subtract } from "./subtract.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 9876 });

const service = {
  add,
  subtract,
};

console.log("RPC server starting at :9876");

for await (const req of server) {
  await respondRpc(req, service);
}
```

## The consumer

We just created a math service, but we need something to consume it.
Here, we will create the consumer for the service, that adds and subtracts two numbers (pretty basic right? its pretty powerful).

We will start by creating a new file named `consumer.ts`,
and subsequently importing the `createRemote` module from the `gentleRpc` library.

```ts title=consumer.ts
import { createRemote } from "./deps.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new remote to the RPC server listening on port `9876`.

```ts title=consumer.ts
const remote = createRemote("http://localhost:9876");
```

Now, we can consume the methods we exposed via RPC.

```ts title=consumer.ts
console.log("Adding 10 and 2 gives", await remote.add(10, 2));
console.log("Subtracting 10 from 2 gives", await remote.subtract(10, 2));
```

> Here we used top-level `await`s

To sum up the consumer code,

```ts title=consumer.ts
import { createRemote } from "./deps.ts";

const remote = createRemote("http://localhost:9876");

console.log("Adding 10 and 2 gives", await remote.add(10, 2));
console.log("Subtracting 10 from 2 gives", await remote.subtract(10, 2));
```

## Running the service

Now, its pretty simple to run the service,

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net services/math/index.ts
Check file:///Users/akshitgarg/dev/learn/deno/part-2/services/math/index.ts
RPC server starting at :9876
```

Why did we use the `--allow-net` flag here?
Well we exposed the RPC server on HTTP, so the `net` permission is required.
Same for the consumer, it needs to consume the RPC service running on HTTP, so it needs the `net` permission too.

Now, as the service is up, let's try running the consumer

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net consumer.ts
Check file:///Users/akshitgarg/dev/learn/deno/part-2/consumer.ts
Adding 10 and 2 gives 12
Subtracting 10 from 2 gives 8
```

12, which is surely the sum of 10 and 2 are back from the RPC service.

## TL;DR

Here, we implemented the microservice pattern, but on a very basic level.
We created a math service, and a consumer to consume the service and print the addition and the difference of two numbers.
