title: Hello Oak
---

So what exactly is oak? Oak is a a middleware framework for Deno's http server, and includes a router middleware for easy routing.

To setup oak, we will first create a `deps.ts` file, which will help us manage the dependencies as deno doesn't use a `package.json` or similar.

```ts title=deps.ts
export { Application } from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```

Here, we export the `Application` module from `https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts`.
We used oak version `v6.0.1`.

## Oak Hello World

So, let's begin by creating a hello world in oak.
Open up a new file named index.ts, and start by importing the `Application` module from `deps.ts`

```ts title=index.ts
import { Application } from "./deps.ts";
```

Now, we need to instantiate the Application class.

```ts title=index.ts
const app = new Application();
```

Next, we need to start our `app` on a HTTP port.

```ts title=index.ts
console.log("Starting on http://localhost:3000");
await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

Notice how we used `await` on the top-level.
Deno has support for top-level `await`, meaning no more `async function main()`.

So now, start the application using your command line.

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net index.ts
Check file:///Users/akshitgarg/dev/learn/deno/part-2/index.ts
Starting on http://localhost:3000
error: Uncaught TypeError: There is no middleware to process requests.
      throw new TypeError("There is no middleware to process requests.");
            ^
    at Application.listen (application.ts:348:13)
    at index.ts:29:11
```

Oops!

So as you know, oak is a middleware framework, it needs atleast one middleware to start-up.
Oak's API is very similar to node's koa.
Now we will create a "Hello World" middleware.

Now before the listen line, add

```ts title=index.ts
app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.response.body = "Hello World!";
});
```

After doing this, run the server again.
This time, the server should successfully start up, and opening `localhost:3000` should show us "Hello World!".

In the next section, we will learn basics of routing with oak.

## TL;DR

In this section, we created a basic HTTP server using oak. The code for the same is as follows:

```ts title=index.ts
import { Application } from "./deps.ts";

const app = new Application();

app.use((ctx) => {
  ctx.response.body = "Hello World!";
});

console.log("Starting on http://localhost:3000");
await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

```ts title=deps.ts
export { Application } from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```
