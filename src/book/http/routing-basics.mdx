title: Routing
---

In the [previous section](/http/hello-oak), we started with oak, which is a middleware framework for deno, inspired by koa.
In this section, we will learn the basics of routing.

So first, we need to export the `Router` module along with the `Application` module in our `deps.ts` file.

```ts title=deps.ts
export { Application, Router } from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```

Now we are ready to start complex routing.
First step would be to create a new folder named `routes`, and create the files `dino.ts` and `index.ts` in it.
The folder structure should now look like:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── deps.ts
├── index.ts
└── routes
    ├── dino.ts
    └── index.ts

1 directory, 4 files
```

Now in the `routes/dino.ts` file, we will start by importing the `Router` module.

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
import { Router } from "../deps.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new instance of the `Router` class, and give it a prefix of `/dino`.
This will make our router available on the `/deno` route of the server.

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
const router = new Router({
  prefix: "/dino",
});
```

Now, we can create a `/hello` resource for the router as follows:

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
router.get("/hello", (ctx) => {
  ctx.response.body = "Mr. Dino says Hello!";
});
```

The `ctx` parameter follows a very similar API to koa's `Context`.
The full API docs can be found [here](https://github.com/oakserver/oak#context).

Now, we can export the router to be used in other files.

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
export default router;
```

Now, in our `routes/index.ts` file, we can export the `dino` router.

```ts title=routes/index.ts
import DinoRouter from "./dino.ts";

export { DinoRouter };
```

This allows us to import all our routes from the `routes/index.ts` file, resulting in a cleaner code.

Now, we need to mount this route to our application.
The `Router.routes()` function exports a middleware, which we can use in our oak application.

Now, in our `index.ts` file, we need to import the routes previously exported.
To do this, add the following after the import from `deps.ts`

```ts title=index.ts
import { DinoRouter } from "./routes/index.ts";
```

Notice that here we import `DinoRouter` from `./routes/index.ts` instead of `./routes`.
This is a part of deno's goal to be browser compatible, as `import` in the browser requires the full path including the file extension.

Now back on the application, we can now use the middleware imported in our app.

```ts title=index.ts
app.use(DinoRouter.routes());
```

As explained earlier, a `Router.routes()` is an oak middleware which we can consume using `app.use(<middleware>)`.

Finally, run the application with `deno run --allow-net index.ts`.
Opening `localhost:3000/dino/hello` should give "Mr. Dino says Hello!", which means we've successfully used the `DinoRouter`.

In the next section, we will learn more advance routing methods, and HTTP verbs.

## TL;DR

In this section, we learnt how to create a new `Router` and use it in our application.
The code for the same is available [here](https://github.com/gargakshit/deno-book-code/tree/basic-routing).
