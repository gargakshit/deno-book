title: Advanced Routing
---

In the [previous section](/http/routing-basics), we covered the basics of routing with oak.
In this section, we will cover advanced routing, with HTTP verbs and route parameters.

## Route Parameters

Route parameters are a basic part of dynamic routing.
In this section, we will be able to query the API using routes like `/dino/t-rex` and `/dino/stegosaurus`,
but this doesn't mean we will create a new route for each dinosaur on the list.
This is when dynamic routing and route parameters come into play.
They allow us to query the routes dynamically.

To being with, open your `routes/dino.ts` file created in the last section.
Add a new `router.get` call to handle the dynamic route.

```ts file=routes/dino.ts
router.get("/:dino", (ctx) => {
  ctx.response.body = `Mr. ${ctx.params.dino} says Hello!`;
});
```

Now, starting the application and loading `localhost:3000/dino/t-rex` in the browser will show "Mr. t-rex says Hello!",
which means we have successfully made a dynamic route.

Now on the code part. How does it work?

Here, we created a HTTP GET route for `/dino/:dino`, where `:dino` means that oak will accept a route parameter
and expose it using the `ctx.params` object. The `:dino` passed in the URL will be available as `ctx.params.dino`.
It means that if we were to replace `:dino` with `:dinosaur`, we should be able to access the same using `ctx.params.dinosaur`.

## Query Parameters

Query parameters work in a similar fashion as route parameters, but they have one major difference.
You can pass multiple query parameters to an endpoint as opposed to one with route parameters, but route parameters, in general are much cleaner.

Query parameters are the things you pass to the endpoint using `?`.
An example of an endpoint with query parameters is `localhost:3000/dino?name=t-rex&age=31`.
Here, we pass the `name` and the `age` parameter to `localhost:3000/dino` endpoint.

Oak has full support for query parameters.

First, we need to export `helpers` in the `deps.ts` file.
The updated `deps.ts` file looks like:

```ts title=deps.ts
export {
  Application,
  Router,
  helpers,
} from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```

Also, we need to update the imports in the `routes/dino.ts` file to look like following:

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
import { Router, helpers } from "../deps.ts";
```

The `helpers` contains the function `getQuery`, which allows us to extract the query parameters from the `ctx`.

Now add a new `get` handler like:

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
router.get("/", (ctx) => {
  const query = helpers.getQuery(ctx);

  ctx.response.body = `Hello, I am ${query.name}. I am ${query.age} years old.`;
});
```

Here, we create a new `query` object which has the query parameters passed with the endpoint.
Firing up the server and visiting `localhost:3000/dino?name=t-rex&age=31` should say
"Hello, I am t-rex. I am 31 years old."

## HTTP verbs

Till now, we only covered HTTP GET requests, but oak (and deno's standard module server) can do a lot more.
HTTP verbs are a part of the HTTP protocol to give more info to the server about the operation the client is willing to perform.
For example a `POST` request will tell the server that the client wants to add new data, and so on.

There are many HTTP verbs, including:

- GET
- POST
- PUT
- DELETE
- PATCH
- HEAD

and a lot more...

For the sake of simplicity, we will be concentrating on `GET` and `POST` for this section,
as all of the methods share a similar API.

Let's start with a `POST` request here.
`POST` requests are commonly used to add some data onto the server-side (database or something else?).
Subsequently, `POST` requests can accept data, which `GET` requests can't.

Let's start by opening the `routes/dino.ts` file. Here, we will make a new `POST` resource on the `/dino/new` endpoint.

```ts file=routes/dino.ts
router.post("/new", (ctx) => {
  ctx.response.body = "Hello from POST, Mr. Client!";
});
```

Browsers can't directly make a `POST` request, so here we need to use something like [postman](http://getpostman.com)
or [cURL](https://github.com/curl/curl) to test the API. Here, I will be using cURL.

Now, lets fire up the server, and open another terminal to use cURL.

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/dino/new
Hello from POST, Mr. Client!
```

Here, we use cURL to make a `POST` request to `localhost:3000/dino/new`.
"Hello from POST, Mr. Client!" comes back as the response.
We successfully made a `POST` resource.
Opening the same endpoint in the browser will result in a 404 error, which is expected as the endpoint only accepts a `POST` request.

We can implement `PUT` by using `app.put()`, and `DELETE` by `app.delete()` in a similar fashion.
Oak supports many more HTTP verbs.

HTTP verbs are also known as HTTP methods.

## Sending Data

HTTP verbs like `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` can accept data.
It can by anything, like JSON, XML, and even binary.

Oak has native support for `form`, `form-data`, `json`, `raw` and `text` data types.

For this part, we will mostly focus on JSON data, but parsing `form-data`, or anything else supported by oak should be just as easy as JSON.

We would be changing the `/dino/new` endpoint to accept a name as JSON.
First, it needs to be async, as parsing JSON in oak needs to be `await`ed.

```ts title=routes/dino.ts
router.post("/new", async (ctx) => {
  const data = await ctx.request.body({
    type: "json",
  }).value;

  ctx.response.body = `A dino with name ${data.name} created`;
});
```

Here, we use the `ctx.response.body().value` promise to get the JSON data.
`data.name` means that we are using the `name` key in the `data` object which is the parsed JSON sent to the server.

Now, lets fire up the server, and open another terminal to use cURL.

```bash
$ curl -X POST -d '{"name": "Mr Saurs"}' http://localhost:3000/dino/new
A dino with name Mr Saurs created
```

Here, we made a `POST` request to `localhost:3000/dino/new` with some data.
"A dino with name Mr Saurs created" came back as the response, meaning we successfully sent, and parsed the data.

## TL;DR

In this section, we learnt how to make dynamic routes with query parameters and route parameters, different HTTP verbs and sending some data to the server.
The code for the same is available [here](https://github.com/gargakshit/deno-book-code/tree/advanced-routing).
