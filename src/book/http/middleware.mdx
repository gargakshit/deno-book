title: Middleware
---

So what exactly is middleware?
Middleware is a function that is executed in the middle of something (literally?).
For example, we have a webserver.
Now, we need to inject a header for the time taken to complete a request.
The function to do the same should run after the request is processed, and before the response is sent.
This is where middleware comes into play.
It is executed in between of other handlers (the handlers could be middlewares too).
Middlewares are very powerful.
In-fact, oak, the framework we used for HTTP is a middleware framework over deno's standard HTTP modules.

In this section, we will create a basic middleware that logs the requests into the console.
We will re-use the code from the [Routing Basics](/http/routing-basics) section.

We will start by creating a new `middleware` folder.
Subsequently, we will create two files, `index.ts` and `logger.ts` in it.

We will also create a `types.ts` file in our project root.
This will later write the type definations.

The directory structure should look like:

```bash
$ tree
.
├── deps.ts
├── index.ts
├── middleware
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── logger.ts
├── routes
│   ├── dino.ts
│   └── index.ts
└── types.ts

2 directories, 7 files
```

In the `deps.ts` file, we will add `Context` to the existing `oak` import.
This will later help us `type` the middleware.
The final deps.ts should look like:

```ts title=deps.ts
export {
  Application,
  Router,
  Context,
} from "https://deno.land/x/oak@v6.0.1/mod.ts";
```

Now, in the `types.ts` file, we will define the `type` of `NextFunction`, which is used in the middleware functions.

```ts title=types.ts
export type NextFunction = () => Promise<void>;
```

Here, we exported a type `NextFunction` with the signature as a function returning a promise.

Now, in the `middleware/logger.ts` file, we will import the `Context` module from `deps.ts`.
We will also import the `NextFunction` type from `types.ts`.

```ts title=logger.ts
import { Context } from "../deps.ts";
import { NextFunction } from "../types.ts";
```

Now, we will create a new function named `loggerMiddleware`
with two parameters, first one being the `Context`, and the second one `NextFunction`.

```ts title=logger.ts
export async function loggerMiddleware(ctx: Context, next: NextFunction) {}
```

The function needs to be async, as we need to await the `NextFunction`, which is a function returning a promise.
We will also export it, as we later need to import and use it.

Continuing, we will define the middleware itself.

```ts title=logger.ts
export async function loggerMiddleware(ctx: Context, next: NextFunction) {
  await next();
  console.log(
    `[${ctx.request.method}] ${ctx.response.status} ${ctx.request.url}`
  );
}
```

Here, we wait for the next middleware to execute, then console log the request's method (`GET`, `POST`, etc), its status, and its URL.

Now, we in the `middleware/index.ts` file, we need to export the `loggerMiddleware` from `middleware/logger.ts`.

```ts title=middleware/index.ts
export { loggerMiddleware } from "./logger.ts";
```

We could later import the `loggerMiddleware` directly,
but using an `index.ts` file results in a more readable code when we have multiple middleware.

Finally, in our `index.ts` file, we will import the middleware.
Our imports will look like:

```ts title=index.ts
import { Application } from "./deps.ts";
import { loggerMiddleware } from "./middleware/index.ts";
import { DinoRouter } from "./routes/index.ts";
```

And finally we can use the middleware like:

```ts title=index.ts
app.use(loggerMiddleware);
```

Our `index.ts` will now look like:

```ts title=index.tsimport { Application } from "./deps.ts";
import { loggerMiddleware } from "./middleware/index.ts";
import { DinoRouter } from "./routes/index.ts";

const app = new Application();

app.use(loggerMiddleware);
app.use(DinoRouter.routes());

console.log("Starting on http://localhost:3000");
await app.listen({ port: 3000 });
```

Notice, here we used the `loggerMiddleware` before the router itself,
as oak chains middleware. They are executed in the same order as they are `use`d.

Now, running a server and hitting an endpoint should result in:

```bash
$ deno run --allow-net index.ts
Check file:///Users/akshitgarg/dev/learn/deno/part-2/index.ts
Starting on http://localhost:3000
[GET] 404 http://localhost:3000/
[GET] 200 http://localhost:3000/dino/hello
```

We successfully logged the requests using a middleware.

## TL;DR

In this section, we created a middleware that logs the requests.
The code for the same is available [here](https://github.com/gargakshit/deno-book-code/tree/http-middleware).
