title: Hello World
---

We'll, before doing anything else, install deno onto our systems. https://deno.land has a nice guide on how to do so.

Now that deno is setup and running on your system, its time for a real hello world. So create a new file with the name `index.ts`.
```ts lineNumbers=true
console.log("Hello World");
```
Now we can run it using `deno run index.ts`. But wait what about compiling the TypeScript into JavaScript? Deno can natively execute TypeScript, so no more `tsc` :P. So now we should see `Hello World` popup in our console. Nothing fancy? Now let's move forward.
