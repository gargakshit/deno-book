title: Hello HTTP
---

Assuming that you completed the [intro](/hello-world/intro), we will start by creating another file named `server.ts`.
We will start by importing the http server module, which is included with deno's standard library.

```ts title=server.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.62.0/http/server.ts";
```

Here, we imported the `serve` module directly from `https://deno.land/std@0.62.0/http/server.ts`.
In deno, imports can be from the network, meaning no more `npm install` and `yarn`.
This helps with not having the `node_modules` folder, and no more polluted paths due to global dependencies.

Continuing on the HTTP server part, next we need to declare the server variable.

```ts title=server.ts
const server = serve({ port: 3000 });
```

Here, we create the `server` variable as an instance of the `serve` module we just imported.

Next, we need a way to handle the incoming HTTP requests.
`serve` creates an async iterable which we can iterate over and respond to requests like:

```ts title=server.ts
for await (const req of server) {
  req.respond({ body: "Hello World" });
}
```

Next, fire up a terminal, and run `deno run server.ts`.
You will see the following:

```log
error: Uncaught PermissionDenied: network access to "0.0.0.0:3000", run again with the --allow-net flag
    at unwrapResponse (rt/10_dispatch_json.js:25:13)
    at sendSync (rt/10_dispatch_json.js:52:12)
    at opListen (rt/30_net.js:33:12)
    at Object.listen (rt/30_net.js:204:17)
    at serve (server.ts:287:25)
    at index.ts:3:16
```

Oopsie! What is this? This is a deno's feature, not a bug :P.
Deno, by default, is secure, which means you need to manually specify the permissions to allow.
Here, we need access to the network, we can allow that using the `--allow-net` flag.

Now rerun this with `deno run --allow-net server.ts`.
Now you should be able to run it, and opening [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Routing

We successfully built a (really) basic HTTP server, but what about routing?
How to handle routes?
In this part, we will extend our http server with some routes.

We will start by declaring a new `enum` with the name `Routes`

```ts title=server.ts
enum Routes {
  HOME = "/",
  USERS = "/users",
  POSTS = "/posts",
}
```

Now in our for loop, replace its contents with the following:

```ts title=server.ts
for await (const req of server) {
  switch (req.url) {
    case Routes.HOME:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from home" });
      break;

    case Routes.USERS:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from users" });
      break;

    case Routes.POSTS:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from posts" });
      break;

    default:
      req.respond({ body: "Aw snap, this is a 404", status: 404 });
      break;
  }
}
```

Here, we check for each route in our `enum` using `switch case` statements.
As our app grows, this will become more complex, and eventually unmaintainable.
To solve this, in our next section, we will use a deno HTTP framework which abstracts this all for us, making it maintainable again.

## TL;DR

In this section, we created a basic HTTP server using deno's standard library. The code for the same is as follows:

```ts title=server.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.62.0/http/server.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 3000 });

enum Routes {
  HOME = "/",
  USERS = "/users",
  POSTS = "/posts",
}

for await (const req of server) {
  switch (req.url) {
    case Routes.HOME:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from home" });
      break;

    case Routes.USERS:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from users" });
      break;

    case Routes.POSTS:
      req.respond({ body: "Hello from posts" });
      break;

    default:
      req.respond({ body: "Aw snap, this is a 404", status: 404 });
      break;
  }
}

```
