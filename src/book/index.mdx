Have you heard of a new thing that recently appeared in the while? Of-course its deno.

## What is deno?

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust.

Well this looks like another JavaScript runtime. But trust me it isn't.

## What sets deno apart from node?

Deno is secure by default, meaning that applications have no permission (like filesystem, network, etc) unless explicitly mentioned.
Deno also includes built-in tooling like a dependency inspector and a formatter.
It also includes a large set of standard modules, which is missing in node, meaning a warm goodbye to packages like `uuid`.

Enough of this theory, let's jump straight into into code.
